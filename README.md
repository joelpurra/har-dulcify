# [har-dulcify](https://github.com/joelpurra/har-dulcify/)

Extract data from [HTTP Archive (HAR) files](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/), quite possibly downloaded by [har-heedless](https://github.com/joelpurra/har-heedless/), for some aggregate analysis.



## Original purpose

Built as a component in [Joel Purra's master's thesis](http://joelpurra.com/projects/masters-thesis/) research, where downloading lots of front pages in the .se top level domain zone was required to analyze their content and use of internal/external resources.
